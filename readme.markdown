Asheninka Syllable Parser
-------------------------

### Version 0.1.1.0 Alpha
13-June-2016

The first released version.  We expect it to have bugs and it is incomplete. Therefore, be sure to use the File / Project Management / Back up this project capability.  Note that you can insert a comment when backing up and thereby remember what was special about that backup. 

#### Known Issues
* Only the CV Pattern approach is implemented
* There is no documentation other than the Help / Introduction document and what is at[ https://sourceforge.net/p/syllableparser/wiki/Home/]{https://sourceforge.net/p/syllableparser/wiki/Home/}.
* When first starting a view/tool and there are no items, still shows the fields in the right pane.
* When delete an item from CV Patterns, still shows one that should not be there.
* The Spanish user interface probably has many errors in it.  Any corrections are welcome.
