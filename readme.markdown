Asheninka (a Syllable Parser)
-----------------------------

### Version 0.3.0.0 Alpha
6-December-2016

This is an alpha version.  We expect it to have bugs and it is incomplete. Therefore, be sure to use the File / Project Management / Back up this project capability.  Note that you can insert a comment when backing up and thereby remember what was special about that backup. 

There also is a comparison capability on the Tools menu.  Choose the current implementation or a backup and then choose another backup.  The tool will compare the two and show you which items differ between the two implementations.

#### Known Issues
* Only the CV Pattern approach is implemented
* When first starting a view/tool and there are no items, still shows the fields in the right pane.
* When delete an item from CV Patterns, still shows one that should not be there.
* The Spanish user interface probably has many errors in it.  Any corrections are welcome.
