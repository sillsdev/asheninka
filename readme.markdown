This is an alpha version.  It may well have bugs and it is incomplete. Therefore, be sure to use the File / Project Management / Back up this project capability.  Note that you can insert a comment when backing up and thereby remember what was special about that backup. 

Please read the user documentation under the Help menu item.

There also is a comparison capability on the Tools menu.  Choose the current implementation or a backup and then choose another backup.  The tool will compare the two and show you which items differ between the two implementations.

#### Known Issues
* Only the CV Pattern, Sonority Heirarchy, and Onset-Nucleus-Coda approaches are implemented
* The Spanish user interface may have errors in it.  Any corrections are welcome.
* The French user interface may have errors in it.  Some items are still in English.  Any corrections are welcome.
